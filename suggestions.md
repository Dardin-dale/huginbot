Great! Looking at your CloudWatch logs, I can see that:

1. Discord is successfully sending PING requests to your endpoint
2. Your Lambda is receiving them and responding with PONG
3. The signature verification is passing (otherwise you'd see the 401 error)

The fact that you're seeing "Received PING, responding with PONG" means your Lambda is working correctly. However, Discord is still showing the verification error.

## The Issue

Looking at the timestamps, I notice something suspicious:
- Request timestamp from Discord: `1748763318` (in the headers)
- Current date from log: `2025-06-01T07:35:19`

Converting the Discord timestamp: `1748763318` = **June 1, 2025** which matches! But this seems like it might be a test environment issue.

## Most Likely Causes

Since your Lambda is responding correctly, the issue is likely one of these:

### 1. **Response Headers**
Discord might be expecting specific headers in the response. Try updating your PONG response in `commands.ts`:

```typescript
// Handle Discord PING (verification)
if (body.type === InteractionType.PING) {
  console.log('Received PING, responding with PONG');
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ type: InteractionResponseType.PONG }),
  };
}
```

### 2. **API Gateway Response Configuration**
The issue might be with how API Gateway is handling the Lambda response. Check if your API Gateway is configured to pass through the Lambda response correctly.

### 3. **Timing Issue**
The experimental warning about Ed25519 might be causing a slight delay. Discord has a very short timeout (3 seconds) for the verification response.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Add Response Headers
Update your Lambda responses to always include headers:

```typescript
// Add this helper function at the top of commands.ts
function createResponse(statusCode: number, body: any): APIGatewayProxyResult {
  return {
    statusCode,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: typeof body === 'string' ? body : JSON.stringify(body),
  };
}

// Then update your PING handler:
if (body.type === InteractionType.PING) {
  console.log('Received PING, responding with PONG');
  return createResponse(200, { type: InteractionResponseType.PONG });
}
```

### Solution 2: Check API Gateway Integration Response
Make sure your API Gateway is configured for Lambda Proxy Integration. You can verify this by:

1. Go to API Gateway in AWS Console
2. Find your `/valheim/control` POST method
3. Click on "Integration Request"
4. Ensure "Use Lambda Proxy integration" is checked

### Solution 3: Test with curl
Test your endpoint directly to see the exact response:

```bash
curl -v -X POST https://9m1nhz9xb7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/valheim/control \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-signature-ed25519: test" \
  -H "x-signature-timestamp: test" \
  -d '{"type": 1}'
```

This should fail signature verification, but you'll see if the endpoint is reachable.

### Solution 4: Update discord-interactions Package
Check if you're using the latest version of the discord-interactions package:

```json
"discord-interactions": "^3.4.0"
```

### Solution 5: Try Manual Verification
As a test, try temporarily bypassing the discord-interactions package to ensure the response format is correct:

```typescript
// Temporarily replace your verification with a simpler check
if (!signature || !timestamp || !publicKey) {
  console.error('Missing required headers for Discord verification');
  return createResponse(401, { error: 'Unauthorized' });
}

const body = JSON.parse(event.body || '{}');

// Handle Discord PING without verification (ONLY FOR TESTING!)
if (body.type === InteractionType.PING) {
  console.log('Received PING, responding with PONG (TEST MODE)');
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ type: 1 }), // Use numeric value directly
  };
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Try adding the Content-Type header first (Solution 1)
2. Verify API Gateway configuration (Solution 2)
3. Check the actual response with curl (Solution 3)

If none of these work, the issue might be with Discord's verification process itself. Can you share:
- The exact URL you're entering in Discord Developer Portal
- Whether you're including `/prod/` in the URL or not
- Any browser console errors when you save the endpoint URL in Discord

The logs show your Lambda is working correctly, so we just need to figure out what Discord is expecting differently.


Current Implementation Analysis
‚úÖ What's Working Well:

Signature Verification: You're using the official discord-interactions package with verifyKey, which is the recommended approach
Header Handling: You're checking for both lowercase and uppercase header variants
PING/PONG Response: Your PING handler returns the correct format: { type: 1 }
Environment Variables: Public key is properly passed via environment variables

üîç Potential Issues:

API Gateway Lambda Integration Type

In valheim-stack.ts, you're using new LambdaIntegration(commandsFunction)
While CDK typically defaults to proxy integration, we should verify this is explicitly set


Response Format

Your responses look correct, but let's ensure they exactly match Discord's expectations


CORS Configuration

You have CORS configured, but Discord's verification might not need it


Error Handling in Verification

The verifyKey function might be throwing an error that's not being caught properly



Recommended Analysis Points:
1. CloudWatch Logs Check
Can you check the CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function when Discord attempts verification? Look for:

The exact request body and headers Discord sends
Any errors during the verifyKey execution
The exact response being returned

2. API Gateway Configuration
In the AWS Console, verify:

Integration Request ‚Üí "Use Lambda Proxy integration" is checked ‚úì
The Integration Response settings

3. Testing the Endpoint Directly
Try testing your endpoint with curl to see the exact response:
bashcurl -X POST https://your-api-gateway-url/valheim/control \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-signature-ed25519: test" \
  -H "x-signature-timestamp: test" \
  -d '{"type": 1}'

1. Signature Verification Implementation
Your code uses the discord-interactions package's verifyKey function, which is good. However, I notice:

You're passing event.body || '' to verifyKey
The function expects the raw body string, which should work with Lambda proxy integration

2. API Gateway Setup
In valheim-stack.ts, you're using:
typescriptcommandsResource.addMethod("POST", new LambdaIntegration(commandsFunction));
CDK's LambdaIntegration defaults to proxy integration, but it's worth being explicit.
3. Response Headers
Your PING response includes Content-Type headers, which is good practice though not strictly required by Discord.
4. Potential Timing Issues
No explicit timeout handling for the 3-second Discord requirement.
Questions Before Making Changes:

CloudWatch Logs: When Discord attempts verification, what exact logs do you see? Specifically:

Is the PING request reaching your Lambda?
What's the exact response being returned?
Any errors in the logs?


API Gateway Settings: Can you confirm in AWS Console that:

API Gateway ‚Üí Your API ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí POST ‚Üí Integration Request
"Use Lambda Proxy integration" is checked?


Public Key Format: How are you setting DISCORD_BOT_PUBLIC_KEY?

Is it exactly as shown in Discord Developer Portal?
No extra spaces or newlines?


Deployment: After making changes, are you:

Running cdk deploy?
Discord might cache failed endpoints briefly


API Gateway Stage: Are you using the full URL including the stage?

e.g., https://xxx.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod/valheim/control



Other Code Sections to Review:
Would you like me to see:

The utils/aws-clients.ts file (to understand the shared utilities)
The actual environment variable configuration (how DISCORD_BOT_PUBLIC_KEY is set)
Any deployment scripts or GitHub Actions
The scripts that are deployed to S3 (especially if they interact with Discord)

The most common issue with Discord verification is that API Gateway modifies the request body before it reaches Lambda, breaking signature verification. Your implementation looks correct, but let's verify these specific points before making changes.
