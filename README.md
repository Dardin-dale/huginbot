2. Create a new application or use an existing one
3. Under "Bot" section, create a bot and copy the token
4. Copy your Application ID from the "General Information" tab
5. Copy your Public Key from the "General Information" tab
6. Create a custom authentication token for your bot (can be any secure random string)
7. Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   DISCORD_APP_ID=your_discord_client_id_here
   DISCORD_BOT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_discord_bot_public_key_here
   DISCORD_BOT_SECRET_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   DISCORD_AUTH_TOKEN=your_custom_auth_token_here
   ```

8. Add the bot to your Discord server with the following permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Read Message History
   - Use Slash Commands

## Deployment

1. Deploy the CDK stacks:
   ```
   npm run cdk deploy --all
   ```
   Or deploy individual stacks:
   ```
   npm run deploy:valheim    # Deploy just the Valheim server stack
   npm run deploy:discord    # Deploy just the Discord integration stack
   ```

2. The deployment will output API Gateway endpoints that you need to configure in your Discord application settings.

3. To undeploy all resources when finished:
   ```
   npm run cli
   ```
   Then select "Undeploy All Infrastructure" and follow the confirmation prompts.
   
   > ⚠️ **Warning**: Undeploying will permanently delete all AWS resources including EC2 instances and S3 buckets with your world backups. Make sure to download your backups first!

## Usage

### CLI Commands

* `npm run build`   - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
* `npm run watch`   - Watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    - Run Jest unit tests
* `npm run cli`     - Launch the CLI interface
* `npm run cdk`     - Run CDK commands

### Local Testing

To test a Valheim server locally:

1. Launch the CLI:
   ```
   npm run cli
   ```

2. Select "Configure Local Testing" and follow the prompts
3. Select "Start Local Test Server" to run a mock server
4. Launch Valheim and connect to `127.0.0.1:2456`

The local test server simulates the AWS deployment and allows you to test server controls and Discord integration without deploying to AWS.

### Managing Worlds

1. Launch the CLI:
   ```
   npm run cli
   ```

2. Select "Manage Worlds" to:
   - Add new worlds
   - Configure Discord server associations
   - Edit world settings
   - Remove worlds

### Custom Worlds and Pre-existing Saves

You can set up custom worlds with pre-existing save data:

1. Place your world files in the `worlds/WORLD_NAME/` directory:
   ```
   worlds/MyWorld/
   ├── MyWorld.db
   ├── MyWorld.fwl
   └── ... (other world files)
   ```

2. During deployment, these files will be used to bootstrap your Valheim server

HuginBot will automatically recognize worlds in the `worlds/` directory and make them available for selection.

### Installing Mods

HuginBot supports BepInEx mods through the lloesche Docker container:

1. Place your mod files in the `mods/` directory:
   ```
   mods/
   ├── SomeValheimMod.dll
   ├── AnotherMod/
   │   ├── AnotherMod.dll
   │   └── assets/
   └── ... (other mod files)
   ```

2. During deployment, these mods will be installed in the BepInEx plugins directory

The server automatically enables BepInEx for all installed mods.

#### Performance Optimizations

HuginBot implements several performance optimizations for the Valheim server:

1. **Persistent Game Files**: Game files are stored in a persistent volume at `/opt/valheim` to avoid re-downloading the game on each container restart, significantly reducing startup time.

2. **Process Prioritization**: The Docker container is given the `sys_nice` capability, allowing the server to better manage process priorities and improve performance under load.

### Discord Commands

Players can use the following commands in Discord:

- `/valheim start [world_name]` - Start the server with optional world name
- `/valheim stop` - Stop the server
- `/valheim status` - Check server status
- `/valheim worlds` - List available worlds

## Architecture

HuginBot uses a simplified architecture with built-in Docker container features:

- **CloudFormation/CDK**: Infrastructure as code
- **API Gateway**: HTTP endpoints for Discord interactions
- **Lambda Functions**: Server control and processing
- **EC2**: Game server hosting with Docker container
- **S3**: World backups and storage
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Configuration and webhook storage
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logs

### Key Architectural Features

- **Direct Container Webhooks**: The Valheim server container directly sends Discord notifications using webhooks
- **Built-in Log Filtering**: Server detects and notifies on important events (join codes, player activity)
- **Server Lifecycle Hooks**: Notifications are sent automatically on server start/stop/backup events
- **Single EC2 Instance**: All functionality is consolidated in one EC2 instance running the Docker container

### Cost Estimation

The project is designed to be cost-effective:

- **EC2 Instance**: Only runs when players are active (~$0.05-0.10/hour for t3.medium when running)
- **Serverless Components**: Minimal costs since they only run on-demand
  - Lambda: Free tier covers most usage
  - API Gateway: ~$1/month for typical usage
  - S3 Storage: ~$0.023 per GB/month for backups
  - CloudWatch: Basic monitoring included
  - **AWS Secrets Manager**: ~$0.40/month per Discord webhook secret (secure webhook URL storage)
- **Total Monthly Cost**: Around $5-20/month depending on usage

**Security & Automation Costs:**
- Discord webhook URLs are securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- No manual parameter creation required - fully automated via CDK
- Webhook URLs encrypted at rest and can be updated via Discord commands

The EC2 instance automatically shuts down after 10 minutes of inactivity to minimize costs.

## Backup System

The server automatically backs up to S3 on a schedule (default: daily). You can:

1. View and manage backups using the CLI (`npm run cli` → "Download Backup"):
   - Select a world to browse its backups 
   - Choose a specific backup to download
   - Restore world files directly to your `worlds/` directory
   - Download full backups for manual inspection

2. Restore worlds from backups:
   - Restore directly to your local `worlds/` folder
   - Launch a test server with the restored world
   - Deploy the restored world to AWS

Backup retention is configurable through the `BACKUPS_TO_KEEP` environment variable.

## Multiple Worlds Support

HuginBot simplifies managing multiple Valheim worlds:

1. **Simplified Configuration**:
   - Each world has a world_name that determines both the server name and world save name
   - No need to manage separate server_name and world_name parameters

2. **Discord Server Integration**:
   - Each Discord server can be linked to a specific world
   - Players can only control their own server's world
   - Prevents accidental overwriting of other servers' progress

3. **World-Specific Backups**:
   - Backups are organized by world name in S3
   - Each world maintains its own backup history
   - Automatic cleanup maintains the specified number of backups per world

## Development and Testing

To test locally without incurring AWS costs:

1. Set up a local environment:
   ```
   npm run cli
   ```
   Then choose "Configure Local Testing" followed by "Start Local Test Server"

2. Run all tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

3. Run specific test categories:
   ```
   # Test webhook integration
   npm test -- test/webhook-integration.test.ts
   
   # Test log pattern matching
   npm test -- test/log-patterns.test.ts
   
   # Test Lambda functions
   npm test -- test/lambdas/
   ```

4. Run tests in watch mode (useful during development):
   ```
   npm test -- --watch
   ```

5. Test coverage:
   ```
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Discord Slash Commands Not Working**
   - Verify your API Gateway endpoint is correctly configured in Discord Developer Portal
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for Lambda function errors
   - Ensure the bot has appropriate permissions in your Discord server

2. **Server Won't Start**
   - Check EC2 instance limits in your AWS account
   - Verify IAM permissions for Lambda to start EC2 instances
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for error messages

3. **World Files Not Found**
   - Ensure world files are correctly placed in the `worlds/` directory
   - Verify file naming follows the pattern `WorldName.db` and `WorldName.fwl`
   - Check S3 bucket permissions

4. **Auto-Shutdown Too Quick**
   - The server auto-shuts down after 10 minutes of inactivity by default
   - Modify the `idleThresholdMinutes` value in `valheim-stack.ts` to adjust this

5. **Discord Authentication Failures**
   - Ensure your `DISCORD_AUTH_TOKEN` matches between your .env and what's deployed
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for authentication errors
   
6. **Discord Notifications Not Working**
   - Run the webhook integration tests: `npm run test test/webhook-integration.test.ts`
   - Verify the webhook URL is correctly set in SSM Parameter Store
   - Check that your Discord channel allows webhook posts
